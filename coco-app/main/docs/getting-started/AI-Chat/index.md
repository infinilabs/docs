> 💡 **Tip**: When switching assistants in the same conversation, Coco AI will automatically retain the context of the current conversation. This means you can let different assistants take turns answering or supplementing analysis in the same round of conversation without re-entering background content.



#### Bottom Function Bar

The function buttons at the bottom left of the input box can quickly call the following capabilities:

| Function             | Icon | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Deep Think Switch** | 🧠    | Turn on or off the deep think capability (only available for assistants in deep think mode). |
| **Search Switch**    | 🌐    | Call the data sources connected in the Coco Server for real-time search. (Some data sources can be selected as needed) |
| **MCP Switch**     | 🔨    | Call external tools or commands, such as database query, translation, task execution, etc. |

> **💡 Tip**: Search and MCP tool calls rely on the currently connected Coco Server, and their availability depends on server configuration.
