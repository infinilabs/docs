To use the **AI Overview** feature, you need to configure it in the settings:

1. Open the **Settings** page and select the **Extensions** option.

2. In the **AI Overview Extension** configuration, choose an **AI assistant** that you want to use for summarization.

3. Configure the **trigger strategy**:
   - **Minimum number of search results**: Set the minimum number of search results required to trigger AI Overview.
   - **Minimum input length**: Set the minimum length of the input query; the summary function will only start when the input content is long enough.
   - **Delay after typing stops**: Set the time delay after input stops to start the summary function, avoiding unnecessary summaries triggered by frequent input.

4. After saving the settings, in search mode, press `Meta + O` to enable the AI Overview feature, and AI Overview will automatically generate summaries for the search results according to your configuration.

   


> 💡 **Tip**: **The style and depth of the summary depend on the AI assistant you choose.**
>
> Think of it as an "information assistant"; the role you assign to it determines its reporting style:
>
> - **"Summary Abstract" assistant**: Provides quick, general summaries.
>
> - **"Technical Expert" assistant**: May generate summaries that focus more on technical specifications and code snippets.
>
> - **"Market Analyst" assistant**: Will pay more attention to market data, competitive dynamics, etc.
>
>
> 💡 **Tip**: **For faster response speed**
>
> If you pursue **ultimate response speed**, it is recommended to configure an assistant using a **fast token-generation, non-inference type model** for the AI Overview feature. Such models can quickly generate summaries for you, making information acquisition smooth.
