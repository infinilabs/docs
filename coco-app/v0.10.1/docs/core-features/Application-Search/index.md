To use the **AI Overview** feature, you need to configure it in the settings:

1. **Search Scope**
   Specify the paths where Coco AI will search for executable applications.

   - For example:
     - macOS: `/Applications`, `~/Applications`
     - Windows: `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local`
   - You can add or remove paths according to actual needs to avoid displaying irrelevant programs.

2. **Rebuild Index**

   Rescan and update the local application index.

   - Usually, there is no need to perform this manually.
   - If you find that an installed application does not appear in the search results, you can click **Rebuild Index** to manually retry and update the results.
